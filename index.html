        <p class="lead mb-4">Warm greetings possible future employer, my name is Malcolm Bunns. I am currently a new programmer that specializes in creating websites. I am looking for a job to develop my skills and knowledge, and I wish to contribute as much as I can. I am still a college student University of California Riverside. I am taking the course Computer Science 008 Introduction to Computers. The course is instructed by Professor Toby Gustafson and he has been instructing this very course for years! Professor Toby Gustafson is one of the greatest instructors at University of California Riverside. The teacher assistant for my lab section of the course is Xiu Xhang. Xiu Xhang is one of the best teacher assistants in all of University of California Riverside. This course makes you top tier programmer very quickly and I am on my way to being one. Now what experience have I gathered from such a remarkable course available at University of California Riverside in such a rapid of time you may ask? The first lab I were assigned was to create website for a certain company of our interest. For my website I choose the extremely popular company Nintendo. For this lab, I got to learn how to make a title for the website with its own colored background of our choosing. I then choose the latest and greatest product from the company of our choosing and made a listing of the productâ€™s features that are better than the company previous and might interest potential customers. The product I choose for new Nintendo was the Nintendo Switch which their most powerful gaming console to date. After listing the products features, I also added input functions to allow customers to make an order for the Nintendo Switch by inputting their first name, last name, telephone number, and sex.  Next, I created a table that listed two versions of the Nintendo Switch, the standard version and the lite version which servers solely as a handheld, and their prices, respectively.  This lab taught me the very fundamentals of website creation. The second lab that was assigned to me was a bit more complicated. Instead of creating a company website with their product, I created a personal website that gave a bit of insight of myself. I learned how to change the font of the text on the website including the title and body. Next, I put a YouTube video on the website. After that, I wrote a small bio of myself that included my favorite foods followed by emojis. Learning the emojis are technically not an actual image and you can code them into the website like regular text was remarkably interesting. Someday I wish to create emojis, so this was very insightful. The most difficult part of the website to create was for sure the social media button. That was the first functioning button I ever coded. Hopefully this brief and detailed bio gave you more inclination to hire me for the position. Thank you for your time!<br><br>
